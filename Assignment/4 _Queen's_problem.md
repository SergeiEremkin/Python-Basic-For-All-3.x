**4 - Queen's problem**
In **4- queens problem**, we have 4 queens to be placed on a `4*4` chessboard, satisfying the constraint that no two queens should be in the same row, same column, or in same diagonal.

The solution space according to the external constraints consists of 4 to the power 4, 4-tuples i.e., Si = {1, 2, 3, 4} and 1<= I <=4, whereas according to the internal constraints they consist of 4! solutions i.e., permutation of 4.
