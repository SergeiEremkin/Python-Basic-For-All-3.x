```
## Saving the files:
``` 
1. **py** Regular scripts
2. **pyc** Compiled script (Bytecode)
3. **py3** (rarely used) Python3 script
4. **pyo** optimized pyc bytecode file
5. **pyw** Python Script for windows exectable
6. **pyx** Cython src to be converted to C/C++
7. **pyd** Python script made as a Windows DLL
8. **pxd** Cython Script which is equivalent to a C/C++ header
